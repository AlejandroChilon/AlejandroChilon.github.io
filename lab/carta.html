    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a petty open-minded
        recearch facility - as long as the subject fall somewhere
        in the realm of science and technology. You seam like an intelligent, 
        dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like
        to have on our team. Staying that, of the ideas you submint
        we were most intigred by are as follows, in oreder of priotiry: 
    </p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Turing H2O into wine, and the heath benefist of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub> )</li>
        <li>Measuing the effect on perfomrmance of ufnk bassplayers at
            tempratures exceding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size 
            exponentially encreases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup> 3x10 <sup>4</sup>.)
        </li>
        <li>HTML and CSS contructs for representing musical scores</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        So place can you provide more imformation on each of these
        subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to 
        take, required staff and other resources, and anything else
        you thing we'd need to know? Thanks. 
    </p>

    <h2>Exotic dance movies</h2>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, 
        I <em>did</em> study exotic trbal dances. To anwer your 
        questions, my favorite dances are follows, with definitions.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Polinecian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>
                A little know but <em>very</em> influential dance dating 
                back as far as 300BC, a whole village woult dance around in
                circle like kitchens, to encogurage their livestock or be "Fruitful".
        </dd>

        <dt>Icelandie brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting 
            warm, they used to practice this dance, whitch inloved huddling
            close together in a circle on the floor, and shufling  their bodies
            arounf in inpeceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my 
            fellow satudents used to sity that he thought this dance inspired
            modem atyles such as Tweking
        </dd>

        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>
            An interesting exameple of historie misinformation, English
            explorers in the 1960 <sub>s</sub> believed to have discovered
            a new dance style characterised by "Robotic", stilted movements 
            being practiced by inhabitants of Northen Alaska and Canada. Later 
            on however it was discovered that they were kjust moving like 
            this because they were really cold
        </dd>
